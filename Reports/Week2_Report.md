## Retrospective
1. Appreciation: Every teammate's interview answers to continue developing the project. Everyone is contributing to the success of the project and we are working together well.
2. Successes: Had a better understanding on what we are dealing with; more grounded than having a vague project.
3. Failures: Recieved vague answers from the interviews. This was our first week of doing work beyond brainstorming, and our communication could've been better.
4. Barriers: Time is probably our biggest barrier. It is hard to get work done on this outside of our scheduled times, so that's very important to stick to.
5. What we should try next time: We need to make sure we have a place to meet and communicate throughout the week.
